## Submission Instructions

### Overview

  Rock climbing involves ascending walls via specific lines or routes. I want to build a CRUD app that alows users to add routes to a database and then view those routes in a mobile first designed application. My project will be to create an online "guidebook" to climbing areas and routes in Arkansas.
  
### Features

MVP:
    Filters: Users will be able to display routes filtered area or zone.
    Create Areas: Users will be able to create new climbing areas. New areas will appear in the All Areas page.
    Create Zones/Walls: Users will be able to create new zones or walls in specific areas. New zones will appear in the specific area page it was created in.
